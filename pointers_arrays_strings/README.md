# Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This directory contains C programs that focus on understanding:
- Pointers and how to use them.
- Arrays and their differences from pointers.
- String manipulation in C.
- Variable scope in memory.

## Files in this directory:

- `0-reset_to_98.c`: Function that updates an integer value to 98 using a pointer.
- More functions will be added as the project progresses.

All files comply with **Betty coding style** and are compiled using:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
